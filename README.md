# Google Clone

This project is a clone of Google Search, built using React.js, Material UI, and a custom Google Search API integration. The application allows users to search for information and displays results similar to the Google Search page.

## Project Overview

The Google Clone app mimics the search functionality of Google, allowing users to type in a query and view search results. The results are fetched using the Google Custom Search API and displayed in a user-friendly format. 

The app has been designed to closely resemble Googleâ€™s search interface, with options for image search, news, and other Google services. The core functionality is built around React.js, with routing handled by React Router, and the UI is styled using Material UI components.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js** - JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- **React Router** - For routing and navigation between components
- **Material UI** - React component library for faster UI development
- **Google Custom Search API** - API for fetching search results based on user queries
- **React Hooks (useState, useEffect)** - For managing state and side effects in functional components

## Features

- **Search Input**: Users can type search queries and submit them.
- **Search Results**: Results are displayed dynamically based on the search query.
- **Multiple Search Categories**: Users can view results across different categories (e.g., All, News, Images) (TO BE FURTHER IMPLEMENTED). 
- **Custom Search API Integration**: Fetches search results from Google's Custom Search API.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is responsive and works well on both mobile and desktop screens.
